# AsyncWork
Created with CodeSandbox
In this small project I have done asynchronous work of fetching large data of images, now to fetch this data from server it takes time but we can't stop the engine inbetween therefore we use promises and their syntatical sugar counterpart asyn/await to fetch the data in batches, which means we don't fetch the while data but we make bunch of small photos such as only asking for 30 photos at a time.
